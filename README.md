# Classifying track genres
This DS105L project classifies the genre of given tracks (available on Spotify) using supervised learning techniques. By compiling a custom dataset using Spotify's Web APIs, we are able to collect data on over 6000 tracks, including each track's 12 high-level audio features (e.g. energy, valence, danceability, tempo, etc.).

This project aims to do two things:

1) Be able to classify music genres better than humans (accuracy > 55%).
2) Find which input variables are most pertinent in determining the genre of a song.
