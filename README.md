This DS105L project classifies the genre of given tracks (available on Spotify) using machine learning techniques. By compiling a custom dataset using data collected from [Every Noise at Once](https://everynoise.com) and Spotify's Web APIs, we are able to collect data on over 6,500 unique tracks, including each track's 13 high-level audio features (e.g. energy, valence, danceability, tempo, etc.).
