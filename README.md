This project classifies the genre of given tracks (available on Spotify) using machine learning techniques. By compiling a custom dataset using data collected from [Every Noise at Once](https://everynoise.com) and Spotify's Web APIs, we were able to collect data on over 6,500 unique tracks, including each track's 13 high-level audio features (e.g. energy, valence, danceability, tempo, etc.).

## Why?
We made this project in fulfillment of the requirements for the DS105L course taught by the [DSI](https://www.lse.ac.uk/DSI) at LSE. But also because we like music! 🎵

## How can I test it out?
Our model is available online [here](https://ds105.herokuapp.com) (it may be a little slow to load at first because the dyno may be asleep! 💤).

## Where can I learn more about this project?
You can read our project report on our GitHub Pages site: [Predicting Track Genres using Audio Features](https://iuven1s.github.io/ds105-project) ✍️
