This DS105L project classifies the genre of given tracks (available on Spotify) using machine learning techniques. By compiling a custom dataset using Spotify's Web APIs, we are able to collect data on over 6500 tracks, including each track's 12 high-level audio features (e.g. energy, valence, danceability, tempo, etc.).
